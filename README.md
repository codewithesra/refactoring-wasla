# Refactoring Wasla

This project involves building a multi-step signup form with reusable input components and centralized validation using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, as well as a custom hook for step tracking and centralized validation logic for each step using Yup. Additionally, I practiced version control and collaboration workflows using GitHub throughout the development process.

## Technologies used
- React
- Vite
